Inspirational acknowledgments 
Outcast Silver Raiders takes some mechanical inspiration from many roleplaying games. I’ve read and played so many great games over the years, it would be hard to pinpoint where all the different ideas came. That being said, there are some specific mechanics that I can map to a few specific works. They are, in alphabetical order: 

- The Black Hack by David Black.
- The Dark of Hot Springs Island by Jacob Hurst, Gabriel Hernandez, Evan Peterson, and Donnie Garcia.
- Lamentations of the Flame Princess by James Edward Raggi IV.
- Old School Essentials by Gavin Norman. 
- Silent Titans by Patrick Stuart. 

These great games are worth your time and money. They inspired me, they’ve entertained me and my friends, and they will inspire you. 

If you choose to use this third-party license, you are encouraged (but not required) to include the names of these products as influences on your own.
